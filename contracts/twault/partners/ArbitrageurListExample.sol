/// @notice Abstract contract for managing list of addresses permitted to perform preferred rate
///         arbitrage swaps on Cron-Fi TWAMM V1.0.
///
/// @dev    In Cron-Fi TWAMM V1.0 pools, the partner swap (preferred rate arbitrage swap) may only
///         be successfully called by an address that returns true when isArbitrageur in a contract
///         derived from this one (the caller must also specify the address of the arbitrage partner
///         to facilitate a call to isArbitrageur in the correct contract).
///
/// @dev    Two mechanisms are provided for updating the arbitrageur list, they are:
///             - The setArbitrageurs method, which allows a list of addresses to
///               be given or removed arbitrage permission.
///             - The nextList mechanism. In order to use this mechanism, a new contract deriving
///               from this contract with new arbitrage addresses specified must be deployed.
///               A listOwner then sets the nextList address to the newly deployed contract
///               address with the setNextList method.
///               Finally, the arbPartner address in the corresponding Cron-Fi TWAMM contract will
///               then call updateArbitrageList to retrieve the new arbitrageur list contract address
///               from this contract instance. Note that all previous arbitraguer contracts in the TWAMM
///               contract using the updated list are ignored.
///
/// @dev    Note that this is a bare-bones implementation without conveniences like a list to
///         inspect all current arbitraguer addresses at once (emitted events can be consulted and
///         aggregated off-chain for this purpose), however users are encouraged to modify the contract
///         as they wish as long as the following methods continue to function as specified:
///             - isArbitrageur
