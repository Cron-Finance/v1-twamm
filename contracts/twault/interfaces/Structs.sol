///      Suffixes:
///
///      - The suffix of a variable name denotes the type contained within the variable.
///        For instance "uint256 _incrementU96" is a 256-bit unsigned container representing
///        the 96-bit value "_increment".
///        In the case of "uint256 _balancerFeeDU1F18", the 256-bit unsigned container is
///        representing a 19 digit decimal value with 18 fractional digits. In this scenario,
///        the D=Decimal, U=Unsigned, F=Fractional.

///      - The suffix of a function name denotes what slot it is proprietary too as a

///        convention easily aids in understanding what slot a packed value is stored within.
///        For instance the function "unpackFeeShiftS3" unpacks the fee shift from slot 3. If
