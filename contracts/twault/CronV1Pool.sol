/// @title  An implementation of a Time-Weighted Average Market Maker on Balancer V2 Vault Pools.
/// @author Zero Slippage (0slippage), Based upon the Paradigm paper TWAMM and the reference design
///         created by frankieislost with optimizations from FRAX incorporated for gas efficiency.
///
/// @notice For usage details, see the online Cron-Fi documentation at https://docs.cronfi.com/.
///
/// @dev Uses Balancer math library for overflow/underflow checks on standard U256 containers.
///      However, as many custom representations are used (i.e. non native word lengths) there
///      are a number of explicit checks against the maximum of other word lengths.
///      Furthermore there are unchecked operations (this code targets Solidity 0.7.x which
///      didn't yet feature implicit arithmetic checks or have the 'unchecked' block feature)
///      herein for reasons of efficiency or desired overflow. Wherever they appear they will
///      be documented and accompanied with one of the following tags:
///        - #unchecked
///        - #overUnderFlowIntended
///      Identified risks will be accompanied and described with the following tag:
///        - #RISK
///
/// @dev Conventions in the methods, variables and constants are as follows:
///
///      Prefixes:
///
///      - In constants, the prefix "Sn", where 1 <= n <= 4, denotes which slot the constant
///        pertains too. There are four storage slots that are bitpacked. For example,
///        "S2_OFFSET_ORACLE_TIMESTAMP" refers to the offset of the oracle timestamp in bit-
///        packed storage slot 2.
///
///      Suffixes:
///
///      - The suffix of a variable name denotes the type contained within the variable.
///        For instance "uint256 _incrementU96" is a 256-bit unsigned container representing
///        the 96-bit value "_increment".
///        In the case of "uint256 _balancerFeeDU1F18", the 256-bit unsigned container is
///        representing a 19 digit decimal value with 18 fractional digits. In this scenario,
///        the D=Decimal, U=Unsigned, F=Fractional.
///        Finally, "uint128 valueU128F64" is a 128-bit container representing a 128-bit value
///        with 64 fractional bits.
///
///      - The suffix of a function name denotes what slot it is proprietary too as a
///        matter of convention. While unchecked at run-time or by the compiler, the naming
///        convention easily aids in understanding what slot a packed value is stored within.
///        For instance the function "unpackFeeShiftS3" unpacks the fee shift from slot 3.
///        If the value of slot 2 were passed to this method, the unpacked value would be
///        incorrect.
///
/// @dev Fee Points (FP) is a system used herein to calculate applicable fees. THESE ABSOLUTELY
///      SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH BASIS POINTS--THEY ARE NOT BASIS POINTS! It consists of
///      fees, such as a swap fee, expressed in FP. The swap fee is multiplied by the amount
///      of token being swapped and divided by the total fee points (TOTAL_FP), which is 100,000,
///      to obtain the fee. For instance, a swap fee of 0.050% can be realized as follows:
///
///                    token_in x FEE_BP
///         swap_fee = -----------------
///                         TOTAL_FP
///
///                      token_in x 50
///                  = -----------------
///                          100000
